# Introduction
This is my personal Neovim setup. This README.md aims to document the main functionalities and settings of the setup for my own future reference, so I will try to make it as detailed as possible. However, there are things that might be accidentally left out.

# Installation
## Install Neovim and Dependencies
### Nvim
Follow the steps in [neovim documentation](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md) to install Neovim. Note that this configurations will only works with Neovim 0.9.0 and above, and the version in package managers like `apt` might be quite dated, so it is recommended to install using the curl command in the installation guide.

### NerdFont
Go to [nerdfont site]([url](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)) and download a font of your choice on your machine. I use JetBrainsMono Regular.

## Install the configs
### Linux
To install the configs, simply `cd ~/.config` and clone the repo. Next time you open Nvim, the configs and plugins should be installed automatically.
